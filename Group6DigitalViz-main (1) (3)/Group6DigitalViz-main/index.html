                            Inflation is a cost of living indicator as it can be used
                            to assess the impact of increases on the affordability of energy.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Certain developed economies, such as the United States and China witnessed deflation or a
                            decrease
                            in year on year prices in 2009 (in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis), this can
                            largely be attributed to
                            associated economic slowdowns and contractions.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Inflation rates have traditionally been substantially higher for
                            developing economies such as India, relative to more developed
                            nation states such as the United States and the United Kingdom, though India's inflation
                            rate is now more in line with that of other countries.

                In 1965, the energy mix was heavily dominated by crude oil and coal consumption.
                <br> <br>
                The gradual phasing out of coal consumption has led to increasing reliance on natural gas.
                <br> <br>
                However, investment in renewable energy has helped diversify the energy mix in recent years and led to the rapid growth of wind energy consumption.
                <br> <br>
                Notice the funnelling effect from 2005-2020. This suggests energy consumption has gradually reduced.

                How self-reliant is the UK when it comes to energy?
                <br> <br>
                Year on year variation of import contributions suggests that imports play an important part in dealing with sudden changes in demand.
                <br> <br>
                Imports reliance increased at the turn of the century, but through the growth in wind production has begun to decrease again.
                <br> <br>
                Currently, almost 30% of UK energy consumption is imported.
                <br> <br>
                With such a significant part of the energy mix formed of imports, the UK is affected by international politics, prices and shortages.

                How does the UK’s import dependency compare to other countries?
                <br> <br>
                The UK is in a unique position, transitioning from a major exporter to importer.
                <br> <br>
                Other countries have experienced slower change.
                <br> <br>
                The USA has bucked the trend and become a net exporter.
                <br> <br>
                Notice Germany’s outstandingly high reliance on imported energy.
                <br> <br>
                The UK’s reliance on imported energy is comparatively high against other case study countries, but where does this imported energy come from?

                What energy types is the UK importing, and where is it coming from?
                <br> <br>
                Since 2001, imported energy types have diversified largely through the growth of dominance of oil
                imports and phasing out of coal.
                <br> <br>
                The two main imported energy types of Oil and Gas are dominated by supplies from Norway, demonstrating a
                significant reliance. In 2001, Norway supplied around 75% of all oil and gas imports to the UK.
                <br> <br>
                The diversification of suppliers in recent years is largely due to the U.S.A. becoming a net exporter
                and supplying the UK with about 25% of oil consumption and 11% of gas consumption.

                How do countries compare when we look at energy consumption per person?
                <br> <br>
                This interactive chart shows per capita energy consumption. We see vast differences across the world.
                <br> <br>
                The largest energy consumers include Iceland, Norway, Canada, the United States, and wealthy nations in
                the Middle East such as Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The average person in these countries consumes as
                much as 100 times more than the average person in some of the poorest countries.
                <br> <br>
                In fact, the true differences between the richest and poorest might be even greater. We do not have
                high-quality data on energy consumption for many of the world’s poorest countries. This is because they
                often use very little commercially-traded energy sources (such as coal, oil, gas, or grid electricity)
                and instead rely on traditional biomass – crop residues, wood and other organic matter that is difficult
                to quantify. This means we often lack good data on energy consumption for the world’s poorest.

                The U.S. average energy use per person remained steady overall during the 1990-2020 period, but there
                were two more significant decreases in 2004-2012 and after 2018, respectively, and it was found that
                both decreases were due to industrial upgrading and expanding the use of new energy sources.
                <br> <br>
                India as a whole shows a smooth upward trend, also with the smooth development of the country.
                <br> <br>
                The UK has two decreasing trends overall after 2006, similar to the United States, respectively, after
                2006-2011 and 2018.
                <br> <br>
                China has shown a rapid rise in the overall trend during the 30 years, especially after 2002, and the
                initial exploration may be due to the rapid development of manufacturing after joining the WTO.
                <br> <br>
                Overall, average energy use per person is much higher in developed countries than in developing
                countries, but while it is declining in developed countries, it is rising in developing countries.

                    in the countries (Germany, China, India, UK and the US) as they push towards an equitable/

                <h3 style="font-size: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">End Note</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">Key policy decisions in countries like Germany and UK support green energy
                    transitions- but the cost ultimately rises for the end consumer and not producer.
                    US on the other hand has seldom recorded sustainable energy related policies in the last few years.
                    The policies in countries like China, and India show hesitant green commitments- especially after
                    the current political rift. The low carbon footprint transitions energy towards electricity and
                    subsequently questions where it is coming from? What is its source and how is it distributed?
                    Paramount being, who is going to pay for it?
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px; padding-bottom: 250px;">Despite the perplexing investment trends and policy
                    engagements- the investments voiced in early 2022 after the pandemic as well as during the Ukraine
                    war pushes towards production and consumption through sustainable 'self-reliant' sources of energy
                    which readjusts this situation for trends to emerge in the future.
